Data Analysis Basics
1) cleaned data (checking missing values, dropping the row with nan values, checking the frequency of each category, filling the most repeated element, dropping the row s with nan values, summing up and checking for the cleaner data set for both the data sets.)
2) explored and worked on concatenation of data frames.
3) concatenation of the column’s having the save columns.
4) merging data frames using common column’s.
5) checking which is the best one to do.
6) Again making a new column in the excel file by copying few rows of the body of the article column from other excel file. 
7) concatenation of these new data frames and comparing  two column’s and getting the new column with Boolean value.
